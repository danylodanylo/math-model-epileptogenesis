The SeparatrixLine.npy was included in the code repository for convenience of a user. Production of separatrix line data requires running 170x170 simulations, which takes considerable amount of time. However, code (DataGeneration_F1b_Separatrix.ipynb), necessary for this simulation, is also included and SeparatrixLine.npy can be generated anew.}
