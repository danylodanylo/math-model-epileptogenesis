# math-model-epileptogenesis

All materials contained in this repository are complementary to the manuscript 'A mathematical model of neuroimmune interactions in epileptogenesis for discovering treatment strategies' written by Danylo Batulin, Fereshteh Lagzi, Annamaria Vezzani, Peter Jedlicka and Jochen Triesch.

All scripts are written as Jupyter notebooks in Python version 3.7.4.

Figures production scripts (“FigureProduction_F...” and "Suppl_FigureProduction_FS...") are consistent with the numbering of the figures in the manuscript. Data is not uploaded to GitHub and can be generated directly (by running scripts in “DataGenerationScripts” folder). Alternatively, running figure production scripts will create corresponding data folders and execute the data generation scripts before figure production. Figures will be saved in a corresponding folder “Figures/Fig...”. After being generated, data will not be re-generated in case the figure production script is executed again.

DataGenerationScripts folder also contains auxiliary scripts.

Parameter set can be found in “DataGenerationScripts/load_default_parameters.ipynb” and Suppl. 4 of the manuscript.

Simulation-specific parameters can be found in data generation scripts and summarized in Suppl. 5 of the manuscript.

Data from animal model studies can be found in “DataGenerationScripts/load_animal_model_data.ipynb” and summarized in Suppl. 6 of the manuscript. 

Script used for the analysis of the dynamical system (Suppl. 8 of the manuscript) can be found in the “AnalysisScipts” folder.
